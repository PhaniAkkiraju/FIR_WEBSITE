<h1>FAQ'S:</h1>
    <div class="content" id="faq1">
        <h2>What is an FIR?</h2>
    <p>An FIR, or First Information Report, is a document that officially registers a complaint with the police, providing details of an alleged crime.</p>
    <h2>How do I file an FIR?</h2>
        
          <p> Visit your local police station to file an FIR in person. Provide accurate information about the incident, including dates, times, and details of those involved.</p>
          <h2>Can I file an FIR online?</h2>
          <p>In many jurisdictions, online FIR filing systems are available. Check with your local police department or government website for specific instructions</p>
          <h2>What information is needed to file an FIR?</h2>
      <p>You typically need details such as the nature of the crime, the location, date and time of the incident, and any relevant information about the individuals involved.</p>
      <h2>Is there a time limit for filing an FIR?</h2>
      <p>It's recommended to file an FIR as soon as possible after the incident. Delays may impact the investigation, and there might be legal time constraints in some cases.</p>
      <h2> What happens after filing an FIR?</h2>
      <p>After filing, the police will initiate an investigation. You may be contacted for additional information, and the case will proceed based on the nature of the complaint.</p>
      <h2>Should the police file an FIR in all cases involving Children?</h2>
      <p>No, in matters involving children, the police is required to file 
        an FIR only when the offence alleged to have been committed by 
        the child is heinous in nature and punishable with a sentence of 
        seven years or more</p>
        <h2> As a child can I be arrested in the first place?</h2>
        <p>Yes, the police can arrest children if they believe they have 
          committed a crime. Typically, police stations will have a child 
          welfare protection officer (Section 107 of JJ Act 2015) and in each 
          district and city, there will be at least one special juvenile police 
          unit. When the police arrest a child on suspicion of committing a 
          crime, this should normally be done by a Special Juvenile Police 
          Unit(SJPU). If a regular police officer arrests the child, then the 
          child should immediately be placed under the care of the Juvenile 
          Police Unit, or a designated Child Welfare Police Officer(SWPO). 
          (Section 10 of JJ Act 2015).
          The Police can also arrest children who have run away from 
          an institution where they were placed under the JJ Act (Section 26 
          of JJ Act 2015), such as an Observation Home (Section 47 of JJ 
          Act 2015), Special Home or Place of Safety (Section 49 of JJ Act 
          2015).
          In certain circumstances for example, with respect to habitual 
          thieves, the Magistrate can order the adults be detained in prison if 
          they do not execute a bond for good behavior or peace. (The Code 
          of Criminal Procedure 1973 – Section 106). Even though arrests of 
          children are allowed, the Magistrate cannot order a similar 
          detention with respect to children. (Section 22 of JJ Act 2015)</p>
          <h2>What are the responsibilities of the police when they arrest 
            me?</h2>
            <p>The police cannot handcuff you or exert any force when they 
              arrest you (Rule 8(3)(ii), the Bihar Juvenile Justice (Care and 
              Protection of Children) Rules, 2017.)
              ➢ The police officer must, immediately, inform your parents or 
              guardians
              ➢ If they do not release you on bail, then the officer must tell 
              them the location of the JJB where you will be produced. 
              (Section 13 of JJ Act 2015).
              ➢ The police officer, or probation officer if there is one, is also 
              required to prepare a ‘Social Investigation Report’ within two 
              weeks and submit it to the JJB. This contains details that 
              would be helpful for the JJB to make its decisions, such as 
              your family background. (Section 13 of JJ Act 2015.)</p>
              <h2>Who shall produce a Child before the Juvenile Justice Board 
                and in what time frame?</h2>
                <p>A designated Child Welfare Police officer from Special 
                  Juvenile Police Unit should produce a Child before the Juvenile 
                  Justice Board within 24 hours.</p>
                  <h2>Is the police supposed to produce all juveniles before the 
                    Juvenile Justice Board?</h2>
                    <p>In all cases where a Child is apprehended, production before 
                      the Board is mandatory. </p>
         </div>

    <div class="content" id="faq2">
      <h2>What should the police do if a child is apprehended for a crime 
        that is punishable by a sentence of less than seven years?
        </h2>
        <p>In such cases the police should not file an FIR. These are 
          cases where only a DD entry is supposed to be made by the police 
          and the child has to be produced before JJB within 24 hours. The 
          police is required to prepare a social background report of the 
          Child, a report stating the circumstances of the alleged offence, a 
          report about recovery of any stolen articles from the child and age 
          proof of the child along with other relevant documents before the 
          Board before the first hearing.</p>
          <h2>Can the police keep me in jail? </h2>
          <p>A child can never be kept in a police lockup or regular jail. 
            The police must bring you before the 11B within 24 hours (Section 
            10 of 11 Act 2015). If the police does not release you immediately 
            on bail, you can only be kept in an Observation Home (Section 12 
            of 11 Act 2015) until you are taken to the 11B (within 24 hours). 
            The police are also supposed to inform a child welfare officer who 
            is supposed to accompany you to the 11B for the first hearing. 
            (Rule 8(2)(iii), the Bihar Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of 
  Children) Rules, 2017.)</p>
  <h2>I don't know why the police have arrested me. What can be 
    done?</h2>
    <p>The police have a duty to tell your parents or guardians why 
      you have been arrested. They can ask the police for the charges 
      under which you have been arrested. 
      If the police have registered an FIR (or first information 
      report), they have a duty to give your parents or guardians a copy 
      of this FIR (Rule 8(3)(iii), the Bihar Juvenile Justice (Care and 
      Protection of Children) Rules, 2017). An FIR is the document 
      prepared by the police when they get any information about a crime 
      that has occurred. To know more about FIRs.</p>
      <h2>Who can release a child on bail?</h2>
      <p>In petty offences, the police may release a child on bail. But 
        in all non-bailable matters involving i.e heinous or serious offences 
        only the Juvenile Justice Board is authorised to release a child on 
        bail</p>
        <h2>At the time of apprehension of the Child whom should the 
          Police mandatorily to inform? </h2>
          <p>The Police shall mandatorily inform the parents/guardian and 
            Probation officer.
            </p>
            <h2> What is mandatory at the time of apprehension for Police?</h2>
            <p> In no case send the child to lock-up or jailor keep him with 
              adult accused; 
               Not to delay his charge being transferred to the Child 
              Welfare Police Officer from the nearest police station. 
               Not to hand-cuff, chain or otherwise fetter a child; 
               provide appropriate medical assistance, assistance of 
              interpreter if the child cannot understand the language or 
              any other assistance which the child may require;
               give food to the child if he has not had his meals; 
   The parents shall be present during the interview of the 
  child by the police. 
   The child should not be compelled to confess his guilt and 
  he should be interviewed only at the Special Juvenile 
  Police Unit or at a child-friendly premises or a child 
  friendly corner in the police station.</p>
  <h2>How does the JJB decide when to detain me?</h2>
  <p> The JJB has the power to detain you (Section 12 of JJ Act 
    2015), though, this is the exception and the rule is bail. If 
    the JJB decides to allow for your release on bail, your 
    parents or guardians are supposed to submit an 
    undertaking in a certain form (Form 2, the Bihar Juvenile 
    Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2017).
     If you are unable to satisfy the bail conditions for a week, 
    then the JJB is required to modify these to help you 
    (Section 12 of JJAct 2015). 
     The JJB may decide to deny bail if this is against your 
    interests. For instance, if this would bring you into contact 
    with criminals or expose you to moral, physical or 
    psychological danger. (Section 12 of JJ Act 2015). </p>
    <h2>So if I'm not going to be in jail, where will they send me? </h2>
    <p>While the inquiry is going on, you can only be detained in 
      Observation Homes or a Place of Safety. The JJB has to tell you 
      how long you will be detained in the order (Section 12 of JJ Act 
      2015).</p>
      <h2>Who can release a child on bail?</h2>
      <p>In bailable matters, the police can release a child on bail. But 
        in all non-bailable matters involving juveniles, the Juvenile Justice 
        Board is authorized to release a child on bail. </p>
        <h2>Whether Inquiry to determine the age of a child is essential in 
          each case before JJB?</h2>
          <p>NO, the JJB can record a finding based on appearance of the 
            person before it that the said persons is a child and proceed with 
            the inquiry under section 14 or section 36, as the case may be 
            without waiting for further confirmation of age The age recorded by 
            the Committee or the Board to be the age of person so brought 
            before it shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be the true 
            age of that person. (Section 94(1) & (3) of the JJ Act 2015).            </p>
            <h2>What are Petty, Serious, and Heinous Offences?</h2>
            <p>The JJ Act 2015 inserted a new scheme which divided crimes 
              into three categories: Petty, Serious and Heinous. 
              1. Petty Offences: Crimes for which maximum punishment 
              is imprisonment up to 3 years. These include crimes such 
              as assault, causing simple hurt, theft, forgery etc. 
              2. Serious Offences: Crimes for which punishment 
              between 3 to 7 years' imprisonment. These include crimes 
              such as attempt to commit culpable homicide, causing 
              grievous hurt, cheating etc. 
              3. Heinous Offences: Crimes for which minimum 
              punishment is imprisonment for 7 years or more. These 
              include crimes such as murder, rape, dacoity etc. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content" id="faq3">
      <h2>How are things different for the different types of crimes?</h2>
      <p>The manner in which the JJB must conduct its proceedings 
        will now depend on the type of the crime you have been accused 
        of committing. Now, the JJB must first look at the nature of the 
        offence. Different procedures are adopted for different kinds of 
        offences.
         Time Limits: In all cases, the JJBs required to complete its 
        inquiry within 4 months. This may be extended to 6 months. 
        But any inquiry pending after 6 months expire shall be 
        terminated in cases of Petty Offences (Section 14 of JJ Act 
        2015). 
         No automatic termination happens in cases of Serious 
        or Heinous Offences - here the courts can grant an 
        extension even beyond 6 months. (Section 14 of JJ Act 
        2015.)
         Different Legal Procedure: Cases with Petty Offences are 
        disposed of in the same way a Summary Trial is conducted 
        (Section 14 of JJ Act 2015). Those with Serious Offences 
        are conducted the way Summons cases are tried under the 
        Cr.P.C (Section 14 of JJ Act 2015.)
         Different rules on FIR Registration: For Petty Offences or 
        Serious Offences, the police are not supposed to register a 
        FIR. They are supposed to record it in the general diary 
        along with the social background report. Only when a 
        Heinous Offence is alleged can the police register an FIR 
        against a child (Rule 8(1), the Bihar Juvenile Justice (Care 
        and Protection of Children) Rules, 2017).
         Different Duties on Police Investigation: In cases of 
        Heinous Offences, the police must produce statements of 
        witnesses and other documents collected during 
        investigation within one month from the date when the child 
        was first produced. Copies of these have to be given to the 
        child or their parents [Rule 10(5 the Bihar Juvenile Justice 
        (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2017). In other 
        cases, the police must file the Final Report within two 
        months from the date of information (Rule 10 ( 6), the Bihar 
        Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 
        2017).</p>
        <h2>What happens when it is a Heinous Offence? </h2>
        <p>If the inquiry is about Heinous Offences, then it becomes 
          crucial to determine whether the child is above or below the age of 
          16 years. If the child is below 16 years, the JJB conducts an inquiry 
          just like it would for a Serious Offence i.e., where a summons case 
          procedure is followed. But if the child is older than 16, then the JJB 
          must conduct a 'Preliminary Assessment’ (Section 15 of JJ Act 
          2015.).</p>
          <h2>What is a Preliminary Assessment? </h2>
          <p>If a child is above 16 years, and is alleged to have committed 
            a Heinous Offence, the JJ Act allows for the proceedings to be 
            conducted under normal procedures like an adult and not the childfriendly procedures of the JJ Act. To decide whether a child should be tried by regular procedure, the JJB must conduct a 'Preliminary 
            Assessment'. (Section 15 of JJ Act 2015). 
            The Preliminary Assessment is an attempt to find out whether 
            the child was mature enough to understand his/her acts and their 
            consequences. The JJB can take the help of trained psychologists 
            and experts to arrive at its conclusions, (Section 15 of JJ Act 2015),
            but must complete the inquiry within 3 months. (Section 14 (3) of 
            JJ Act 2015). 
            If the JJB passes an order to keep proceedings under the Act 
            and not send the case to the regular court, the government can 
            appeal against this order. </p>
            <h2>So how are Children tried as Adults? </h2>
            <p>When the JJB decides that a child should be tried as an adult 
              after a Preliminary Assessment, it sends the case to a Children’s 
              Court (Section 18 (3) of JJ Act 2015). The Children's Court may be 
              an existing Sessions Court that is dealing with child-specific laws, 
              or a special court set up for the purpose of dealing with crimes 
              under the JJ Act. (Section 2(20) of JJ Act 2015).</p>
              <h2>How does a Children's Court work? </h2>
              <p>The Children's Court may do one of the following two things 
                (Section 19 of JJ Act 2015). :-
                1. It may decide that the child must be treated like an adult for 
                the trial, and then conduct a regular trial and pass final 
                judgment. While the Children's Court can generally pass the 
                maximum sentence for a Heinous Offence (i.e., it can pass 
                a sentence of more than 3 years), it cannot award the death 
                penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of release 
                in such cases. 
                2. It may decide that there is no need to conduct a trial as an 
                adult, and may conduct an inquiry like the JJB, passing 
                orders under Section 18 of the JJ Act. 
                In all proceedings, the Children's Court must ensure a childfriendly atmosphere is maintained. It must also ensure that the child 
                be sent to a Place of Safety, if detained during proceedings. If he 
                is found guilty of having committing the Heinous Offence, he will be 
sent to the Place of Safety until he becomes 21 years old, after 
which he can be sent to jail (Section 20 of JJ Act 2015.). The child 
should have access to reformative services (like education, skill 
development) when he is at the Place of Safety.</p>
<h2>What is Board and what qualification is required to be a 
  member of the Board? </h2>
  <p>The Juvenile Justice Board is constituted for exercising the 
    powers and discharging its functions relating to children in conflict 
    with law. The board consists of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a 
    Judicial Magistrate of First class as a Principal Magistrate with at 
    least three years’ experience and two social workers, of whom at 
    least one shall be a woman. The social worker appointed by the 
    State Government shall be actively involved in health, education, 
    or welfare activities pertaining to children for at least seven years 
    or shall be a practicing professional with a degree in child 
    psychology, psychiatry, sociology or law.</p>
    <h2>What is the composition of JJB?</h2>
    <p>The JJB consists of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a
      Judicial Magistrate of First Class as the Principal
      Magistrate of the Board and two social workers as
      members. In the earlier law, in many States, it was found
      that the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) or Chief 
      Judicial Magistrate (CJM) were holding the charge of
      Principal Magistrate. As they are already burdened with 
      cases, the cases before the JJB remained unattended leading to huge pendency of cases. In order to 
      address this issue, in the new Act under Section 4(1), it is
      clearly stated that the CMM or CJM cannot be the Principal
      Magistrate of the Board.
      The Social worker members should be persons who 
      have been actively involved in health, education, or
      welfare activities pertaining to children for at least seven
      years or a practicing professional with a degree in child
      psychology, psychiatry, sociology or law.</p>
      <h2>What is the term of members of the Board?
      </h2>
      <p>The term of social worker members of the Board is for
        a period of three years from the date of appointment.
        They are eligible for maximum of two terms which cannot be 
        continuous</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content" id="faq4">
     <h2>What are the provisions for sitting of the Board?</h2>
     <p>The Board is required to hold its sittings in either an
      Observation Home or a Special Home or any place which is
      close to these child care institutions. The Board cannot hold
      its sittings in any court or jail premises.
      The Board is required to sit on all working days for a
      minimum of six hours unless the case pendency is less.</p>
      <h2>What are the provisions in law to ensure JJB members
        are sensitized on the law?</h2>
        <p>Under Section 4(5), the State Government is made
          responsible to provide induction training and sensitisation
          to all members including Principal Magistrate of the Board 
          on care, protection, rehabilitation, legal provisions and 
          justice for children, within a period of sixty days from the
          date of their appointment. Further, under Model Rule 89, 
          theState Government is also required to organize regular
          training programmes for all stakeholders including JJB 
          members on the implementation of the JJ Act, 2015.</p>
          <h2> Who monitors the pendency of cases in a JJB?</h2>
          <p>The Chief Judicial Magistrate or the Chief 
            Metropolitan Magistrate reviews the pendency of cases
            of the Board once in every three months. Based on the
            review, they may direct the Board to increase the
            frequency of its sittings or may recommend the 
            constitution of additional Boards.
            The pendency of cases is also reviewed every six 
            months by a high level c ommit t e e consisting of:
             Executive Chairperson of the State Legal Services
            Authority as the Chairperson
             Home Secretary
            Secretary responsible for the implementation of
JJ Act, 2015 in the State
 a representative from a voluntary or 
nongovernmental organization to be 
nominated by the Chairperson
 The JJB is required to furnish information of
pendency of cases to the Chief Judicial
Magistrate or the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate 
and the District Magistrate on quarterly basis in
Form 12 of the Model Rules.
 The Board is also required to maintain “Case
Monitoring Sheet” of every case and every child in
Form 11 of the Model Rules. The sheet facilitates
tracking and monitoring of timelines of cases
before the Board.</p>
<h2>• Does the Board have power to pass a decision or order

          committing an offence when he was a child?</h2>
          <p>Under Section 6 of the Act, if a person is
            apprehended for committing an offence when he or she was
            a child or below 18 years of age then such person is to be
            treated as a child under the JJ Act, 2015. However, as
            the person is an adult and cannot be kept in an observation
home with children, the Act states that such person is to 
be placed in a Place of safety.
Every State Government is required to establish at
least one place of Safety in a state.</p>
<h2>If the Board is not sitting, can a child be produced
  before a single member of the Board?</h2>
  <p>Yes, a child in conflict with law can be produced before 
    a single member of the Board. The order given by individual
    member is to be ratified by the Board in its next meeting.
    The Principal Magistrate is to draw a monthly roster of
    member who are required to be available and accessible
    every day including Holidays. The roster is to be circulated in
    advance to all police stations, CJM/CMM, District judge,
    District Magistrate, Child Welfare Committee, District Child

      of the case?</h2>
      <p>No, at least two members including the Principal
        Magistrate should be present at the time of final disposal

            prevail.</p>
            <h2>Is the Board required to give bail in all cases brought
              before it?</h2>
              <p>If a child is brought before the Board for committing a
                bailable or non-bailable offence, the Board may release
                the child on bail with or without surety and place him under
                the supervision of probation officer or a fit person. The bail
                may however be denied if there appears reasonable
                ground for believing that:
                 the release is likely to bring him into association with
any known criminal
 expose him to moral, physical or psychological
danger
 his release would defeat the ends of justice</p>
<h2>The Board is expected to adopt child friendly
  approaches, what are these?</h2>
  <p>The child friendly approaches include:
     Ensuring no person un-connected with the case is
    present during proceedings
     Ensuring only persons whom the child f e e l s
    comfortable, are present during proceedings
     The premises should not look like a court room
     Board members should interact with child face to
    face
     Board members should ensure their facial
    expressions, body language, eye contact,
    intonation and volume of voice in addressing children
    is not threatening to child rather it should make the child
    comfortable</p>

      <h2> What are the functions of JJB other than disposing of
        matters related to children in conflict with law?</h2>

          inspection visit every month of Observation Home,
          Special Home and Place of safety and recommend action
          for improvement to the District Child Protection Unit and 
          State Government.
           The Board is also required to conduct regular
          inspection of jails meant for adults to check if any 
          child is lodged in jail. In case a child is found then
          the Board is to take immediate action for transfer of
          child to an Observation home.</p>
          <h2>How does the Boardensure free legal aid forthe child?</h2>
          <p>Every child who files or defends a case is entitled to 
            free legal services under the Legal Servic es Authority
            act, 1987. The Board is to ensure free legal s er vi c es to 
            children through State or District Legal Aid Services
            Authority or through the Legal cum Probation Officer

            volunteers or NGOs for para legal and other tasks such as
            contacting the parents of child and collecting relevant social
            and rehabilitative information about the child.

            <h2>What is the timeline for inquiry if a child commits a
              petty offence?</h2>
              <p>The inquiry is to be completed within four months from 
                the date of first production of child before the Board. The
                period may be extended for a maximum of two months by
                the Board. In case the inquiry remains inconclusive even
                after the extended period then the proceedings stand
                terminated as per Section 14(4) of the Act.</p>
                <h2>What are the timelines for inquiry if a child commits a
                  serious or heinous offence?</h2>
                  <p>The inquiry is to be completed within four months from 
                    the date of first production of child before the Board. The
                    period may be extended for a maximum of two months by 
                    the Board. However, if the Board requires more time, the
                    permission needs to be taken from the Chief Judicial
                    Magistrate or Chief Metropolitan Magistrate after
                    recording reasons in writing.</p>
                    <h2>If a child a g e d 15 years commit a heinous offence,
                      can the Board conduct preliminary assessment?</h2>
                      <p>No, preliminary assessment is to be conducted only
                        when the child completes sixteen years of age. In this
                        case, the Board is to conduct inquiry as per Section 14 and 
                        pass order as per Section 18 of the Act.</p>
                        <h2>• What are the provisions to tackle heinous offences
                          committed by children?</h2>
                          <p>I. If heinous offence is committed by a child below the
                            age of 16 years, then the child is to be tried by the
                            Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) as per the procedures
                            under Section 14 and 18 of the Act. This implies that
                            a child will not be given detention of more than three
years.
II. If heinous offence is committed by a child between
the age of 16-18 years, then the child is first
produced before the Juvenile Justice Board. The 
Board is to conduct a preliminary assessment. The 
assessment is basically to assess the capacity of the
child to commit the offence and whether the child 
understands the consequences of the alleged
offence.
Based on the preliminary assessment, two 
situations may arise:
a) The Juvenile Justice Board decides that the matter
should be disposed of by the Board itself, the Board
follows the procedures as per Section 14 and 18 of
the Act.
b) The Board decides that the child needs to be tried as
an adult and thus make an order to transfer the trial
of the case to the Children’s Court as per Section
18(3) of the Act.
When the matter comes before the Children’s Court,
the Children’s Court has two options:
 The Children’s Court decides that there is no
need for trial of the child as an adult. In such
case, the Children’s Court has the power of the
Juvenile Justice Board as per Section 8(2) of the
Act and therefore instead of transferring the
case back to the Board, the Children’s Court can
conduct inquiry and pass orders accordingly. This
implies that a child will not be given detention of
more than three years.
 On the other hand, the Children’s Court may
decide that there is a need for trial of the child 
as an adult and thus will follow the procedures
prescribed under CrPC. The quantum of
detention in such case is not prescribed in the
Act and has been left at the discretion of the
Children’s Court.
Under Section 21 of the Act, no child for any offence
can be sentenced for life without the possibility of release
or sentenced to death by the Board or the Children’s Court.</p>
<h2>Is preliminary assessment an inquiry by the Board?</h2>
<p>No, preliminary assessment by the Board is to
  assess the capacity of child to commit the offence and if
  the child understands the consequences of the alleged
  offence. To do so, the Board may take the assistance of
  experienced psychologists or psycho- social workers or
  other experts.</p>
  <h2>Can the period of preliminary assessment be
    extended?</h2>
    <p>No, the preliminary assessment should be
      completed within a period of three months.</p>
      <h2>Is the order of the Board in case of preliminary
        assessment appealable?</h2>
        <p>Yes, the order of the Board in case of preliminary
          assessment is appealable under Sub-section (2) of
          Section 11 of the Act.</p>
          <h2>Are there any timelines for police to submitreports to
            JJB?</h2>
            <p>Yes, the Model Rules have laid down timelines under 
              Rule 10, these are:
              • In case of petty or serious offences, the final
              report by police is to be submitted within two months
              of receiving information.
              • In case of heinous offence alleged to have been
              committed by a child above 16 years of age, police
              has to submit statement of witnesses and other
              documents during the course of investigation
              within O N E MONTH from t h e date of first
              production of the child before the Board.

    <div class="content" id="faq6">
     <h2>What is the procedure if police is unable to file final
      report as it is not reasonably known that the person
      involved in the offence is a child?</h2>
      <p>In such cases, extension of time may be granted by
        the Board for filing final report by Police.</p>
        <h2>Can the Board give a punishment of more than three
          years if after preliminary assessment the Board
          decides to conduct inquiry on itself?</h2>
          <P>If after preliminary assessment, the Board comes
            to the conclusion that the child committed the offence 
            with a “child-like” mind then it will keep the case with itself
            and after inquiry it may give order to keep the child in a child 
            care institution for a maximum of three years.</P>
            <h2>What happens in a case where the behavior or
              conduct of a child already placed in a Special Home is
              not in his best interest or in the interest of other
              children?</h2>
              <p>If the behavior of child placed in a Special Home is not
                in his interest or in the interest of other children then in
                such a case, the Board can order for the transfer of the
                child to a Place of safety.</p>
                <h2>What is the procedure for determining age of the
                  child?</h2>
                  <p>The Act under Section 94 gives two possible
                    scenarios. In the first scenario, if on the basis of
                    appearance of the child, the Board decides that the child
                    brought before it is a child then in such case, it has to
                    record its observation stating the age of child as nearly as
                    may be and proceed with inquiry without waiting for further
                    confirmation of age.
                    In the second scenario, if the Board has
                    reasonable ground regarding age of child then it will follow
                    the procedure as per Section 94(2), which is given below:
                    I. Date of birt h certificate from the school or the
matriculation or equivalent certificate from the
examination Board concerned, and in the absence
thereof;
II. Birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal
authority or a panchayat;
III. And only in the absence of (i) and (ii) age is to be
determined by an ossification test or any other
medical test for determining age of child. Provided
the test is completed within 15 days of order by the
Board.</p>
<h2>What are different orders that a Board can give in

    made by the child
    </p>
    <h2>What is the procedure, if a child runs away from an
      observation home or special home or place of
      safety?</h2>
      <p>If a child runs away from a home, the police is required
        to take charge of the child and produce him within twentyfour hours before the Board, which had passed the original 
        order in respect of that child. If the child is found in a
        different district or city or state, then the child is to be
        produced before the nearest Board.
        The Board is to determine the reasons as to why did
        the child run away and gi ve appropriate directions
        keeping the best interest of child as the main 
        consideration. The Board cannot initiate any additional
        proceedings in respect of such run-away child.</p>
